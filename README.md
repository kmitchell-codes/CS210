•	Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The project aims to teach students fiscal responsibility using an interactive system. Specifically, the code is an investment calculator that focuses on demonstrating how investments will grow over time.
•	What did you do particularly well?
I ensured that the main file of my code remained clutter-free and easy to read. Additionally, I separated the visual aspects of the program into a different file with functions that can be called as needed. This approach keeps the code clean and organized.
•	Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
My code could be improved by incorporating classes and eliminating repetitive code, making it cleaner, easier to maintain, and more readable. To enhance security, I could also consider using different programming languages that offer better security features.
•	Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
The most challenging part of the code was handling user input. I found it difficult to get this part right, so I used several resources, including articles from cplusplus.com and books like “The C++ Programming Language” by Bjarne Stroustrup and “Sam’s Teach Yourself C++” by Siddhartha Rao.
•	What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
The skills of handling user input and creating a visually appealing display will be particularly transferable to future projects. These are fundamental skills that I will continue to refine and improve upon.
•	How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
As mentioned earlier, I kept the main file clutter-free and easy to read by placing calculations and display code in separate files. This modular approach makes the program more maintainable and adaptable.
